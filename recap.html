              <h2>Session 0.5</h2>
              <p>It becomes common knowledge that Professor Qin has a residency at the Arcanium, which is not in the city proper. The area is located in the outskirts of Yakanai. 

                Each player character finds their own way to Yakanai. Relevant events that occurred on the way are that Ren meets Sparkles, who is owed a favour by Ren after guiding him towards the correct path. Bamboo goes beside the river pathway that connects to the Verdant Forest Sect, with some people doing maintenance. They also have glowing rocks? The elf people are also annoyed for some reason. Lin also meets up with Ren on their way to the Arcanium.
                
                The group finally meet up all together and Scarlett takes a look at Hansha’s and Ren’s conditions. They also learn that the library in the campus is 
                actually what is known as the Arcanium, but the campus is just colloquially called Arcanium regardless. They meet an airheaded scholar named Li Xue who is very nitpicky about academics. Shenanigans ensue and Scarlett is now considered a quack. Li Xue also had an unhealthy fascination with Bamboo who went Error 404 during this time. Relic and her also have a discussion about chronurgy.
                
                They go to the office after making Li Xue depressed, and met her bitchier but more socially acceptable sister, Wu Xue. She explains that she believe’s this is some cruel fate that her sister and her were reincarnated as twins again and she must have done something terrible in her past life. She is also only there to help her sister out. She takes some gold from Lin and the party separates. Ren and Lin (and 404 Bamboo) stay in the office. Ren decides to relax as he is worn out from the journey and learns more about Wu Xue.
                
                The other three venture off (while having some girl talk) and bump into a junior named Zhi Yuan. He teaches the cultivators of the subgroup to conceal their presence, as if this was natural for people in the area. He learns that the party is “close” with Wu Xue and strikes a deal that he would help them in exchange for a favour (most likely to do with Wu Xue). He is able to get the three into the Arcanium, in order to find Professor Qin. It is also learned that Li Xue is depressed and usually hides herself in a coffee shop nearby.
                
                Lin and Ren (and Bamboo) are kicked out of the office by Wu, and take a stroll outside, where they bump into Zhi Yuan again. Zhi tells Ren that he should be concealing his energy and Ren notices that people seem to be eyeing him down with some sort of envy.</p>

              <h2>Session 1</h2>
              <p>After the closing of the offices, The group collects themselves by Zhi-Yuan’s place of power under the tree of many thoughts, described by Meilin as being less good than their Brother’s bed, but somewhere in the top ten.

                Is the ranking system off, or is the Li family bed simply that powerful?!
                
                Having given up on the Elf Wu, Li seems like a reasonable second option to find the location of the erstwhile professor Qin. 
                
                The Jade Dragon, an ancient relic of legend, said to be able to pull up a cultivator to challenge the heavens themselves; also the name of a coffee shop. 
                
                Scanning through the floors, the group eventually comes across Li in a sound restricted booth on the third floor. There, Relic learns that Wu’s somewhere in the forest, and probably the professor as well. 
                Meilin learns she, in fact, does not have a license for that. With a wave and a write up, the party moves to the forest. 
                
                There they find the fairy claiming to be called Sparkles, whom Hong owed a favour to. In the spirit of giving, in exchange for information about Sparkle’s sister, another favour was given. After giving a gift of song, Hansha found herself owing yet two more favours to them. 
                
                Apparently the Professor is in the forest but we’re not going to find him. No seriously, even Sparkles can’t get to him and he basically has run of the place. 
                
                He requested (read: forced) Hong to find his hand-mirror using up one of his favours. He didn’t want to talk to his sister, the nominal owner of this forest. 
                
                The party passes by some cool flowers and doesn’t get eaten by a tree. 
                They find a clearing with the pool of water they were looking for and an apple tree. The mirror is quickly retrieved without much incident, but Relic jumping into the water and Meilin following reveals shiny stone at the bottom. Meilin takes some. She latter hides it away from the haughty fae lady that coughs awkwardly in the apple tree when the party decides that actually apples just aren’t their jam. 
                
                Jade Moon seems to be very possessive, and is annoyed that people are moving her stuff around. She leads the party over to her covered pagoda to tell them as such. 
                
                “Wow, that seems difficult to solve” goes the party.
                “Well, just tell them that Power taken if not returned will consume, surely that’ll stop them!”
                “Can do!” Says the party.
                
                Bamboo stays behind a moment at Moon’s request, likely to be told that this is reeeaaally not okay for realzies, and they should be the one do do something about this. Being a forest guardian and all. 
                
                In a glade, after some talk about themselves revealing that Meilin’s brother is probably with a dark sect or something else creepy, Relic has been waiting for her Master to come back from the dead aaaany minute now for a literal millennia, Hong came from a backwater where people only say things they’re sure of, and that Bamboo thinks sticks are neat; the party gets to talk to Wu-Xue.
                
                She’s way more accommodating this time! Maybe being in Qin’s office just bummed her out. 
                
                We learn the mirror had, in celestial, the name of the god of tragedy and lost potential on the back. 
                
                Spooky. 
                
                She tells the party that the shiny rock that they found and the city of Yakanai is using to pave the river beds is actually made out of Elven soul. Meilin proceeds to use it like Aloe Vera instead of returning it.
                
                Safe with the knowledge that if we get hurt, we can rub the souls of elves long past on the wounds, the party goes to bed.
                
                Wait, isn’t Wu-Xue an elf? 
                
                Ehhhhh, who cares.</p>

              <h2>Session 2</h2>
              <p>The Party continued their "deep" conversations by firelight until falling asleep. 
                After waking up, they continued to chat until they remembered they still had Sparkle's, the faery's, mirror. Of which Hong's life depended upon. 
                Now Venturing back into the forest with one thought in mind. The party stumbled into a trail with a shallow river and a giant tree on the other side. Attempting to cross it, Relic leaped into the river and summoned some of it's denizens. 
                Then Some ghouls of sorts arose from the river and engaged the party in combat. Soon thereafter, the party quickly dispatched the ghouls. When Bamboo landed the final blow on one, he saw a silver whisp escape from it's corpse as it appeared to say "thank you" to him.
                Quickly, the party found Sparkles sitting on the tree, watching their combat. They gave him the mirror and he released Hong from his debt. 
                The party continued back to the city of Yakanai to hopeful get some answers to their many questions. 
                Along the way back they met up with the apparent foreman in charge of place those magic blue stones on throughout the rivers in the city. They let slip that they know of a new deposit. The foremen informed them that someone would be in touch. 
                The party headed in the city looking for a merchant to procure some fruits to give as a gift to the shrine of the city. Of which, is standing right across from a not so popular establishment, "The Koi Place". 
                Party learned about a cultivator reagent called, "Fruit of the Dragon" and headed over to "The Koi Place". Before entering, they made sure to gift the fruits to the shrine maiden in charge of this location.
                At "The Koi Place", the party antagonized the hostess dubbed "The Matron". The party quickly left, their next move unknown.

              <h2>Session 3</h2>
              <p>Party left the Matron's place to do some shopping.
                Party traveled around the city and visited some stores, specifically some clothing stores to get new threads.
                In additional, the party also stumbled a store ran by an old gnome named Henrik. He operated an odd store that seemed to deal with repairing and selling an odd assortment of goods. Both useful and extra. 
                They also stumbled across an odd curios store ran by a Half-Elf named Shao whereupon they sold the magical blue crystal. Additionally, they met up with an eccentric individual who recruited the party for a job. The job to go into the woods to find and retrieve an old recipe scroll. 
                Afterwards, the party mingled and talked and found respite in a very nice and expensive place called "Eternal Blossom Guesthouse" where the party, if they chose, found companionship. 
                Moving on, the party left Yakanai in pursuit of this recipe and found themselves in the forest next to a river. The soon, a giga moose entered the scene and promptly regard the party as friendlies thanks to Bamboo. 
                The giga moose aided the party after a quick duel, wounding their new friend, by leading them to the destination of their quest.
                The party is left in front of a massive old temple apparently dedicated to a reptilian god. It is night, there are no clouds in the sky and their new friend is acting very shifty.

              <h2>Session 4</h2>
              <p>Party entered the creepy "dungeon". 
                The temple is incredible clean and empty. Party followed some murals that seemed to depict a transformation ritual. Something to do with Yin, Yang, and the consumption of energy.
                Party eventually let someone jump in a hole. He didn't find anything. He got infected and ate a shit ton of food. He kept eating until he eventually lost all self control. 
                Party made the decision to kill him. Just as quickly as they made that choice, they backed out of it, choosing to let him live.... For now. 
                They eventually found themselves in a cave filled with glowing fungai as well as a crystal clear lake complete with a waterfall. Next to the lake was a a series of sealed urns. The urns appeared to be ancient, containing a liquid that seemed to react when picked up.
                Afterwards, the most useful sorcerer did a D&D first. They got a kill with protection from good and evil as they expelled the parasite growing in the man from his body. 
                The party is confusion. 
                We left off with the party next to the recently deceased man, wondering where all their allies went. </p>

              <h2>Session 5</h2>
              <p>The party left Cho to head back to the cave system with the lake and waterfall to chase after the giga worm. 
                They found that the worm escaped into the lake. Afterwards, they decided to split up. Hansha will head back to Cho's body and Kissou and Relic will investigate the waterfall. 
                At the waterfall, they discovered that beyond it lay a path. The path led to a man-made spring with a giant tree in the center. The tree appears to be producing both Yin and Yang energy.
                At the body, Hansha messed with the corpse. Certain events happened resulting in Hansha getting infected. Hansha ran back to the cave system and was immediately attacked by the giga worm. 
                Hansha managed to fend off the giga worm, barley. Kissou went to help Hansha and tried to cleanse her with the waterfall. Memes happened resulting in Hansha being unable to do anything.
                Afterwards, the group made the executive decision to exercise the parasites in Hansha with another protection from good and evil spell cast. The result ended with Hansha dying. Her last moments being incredibly painful. 
                The party continued through the waterfall, approaching tree. A voice reached out to them and offered them the scroll as they have done it a favor. What did they do? The party has no idea.
                Leaving the tomb, the party went back to Yakanai to rest and recover. In Yakanai, Relic and Kissou split up momentarily to deal with private affairs. Relic went the Arcanium to meet up with Wu Xue and Kissou went to deliver the scroll to Shao. </p>
